Here are two main articles you need to go through before jumping into the homework:
- [Monitoring Tools](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/management/overview-java-se-monitoring-and-management.html#GUID-EA3CFF69-F0D3-47AB-9AED-EF1CBF7F2B24)
- [Latency and Throughput](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/java-concurrency-troubleshooting-latency-and-throughput/welcome-to-high-performing-java-applications?u=2113185)

Also, please feel free to visit these references to get more familiar with the tools:
- [Java 21 Troubleshoot Guide](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/troubleshoot/general-java-troubleshooting.html)

### **Prerequisites**
| JDK  | 21.x | [Java 21](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/install/overview-jdk-installation.html)   |
|------|------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Maven| 3.9.x| [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)                                          |

#### Webinar script for presenter:
- We will work with Java 21 tutorials.
- We use only tools provided in JDK. In most cases, they are enough to have.

### **Java Flight Recorder**
Java Flight Recorder (JFR) is a monitoring tool that collects information about the events in a JVM during the execution of Java applications.

JFR is designed to affect the performance of a running application as little as possible.

JFR saves data about the events in a single output file, `flight.jfr`.
